# MyCure

[My Notes](notes.md)

MyCure is a personalized platform designed for people with specific diseases, disorders, or illnesses.
Medical research is constantly advancing, but it can be overwhelming and difficult to access. With MyCure, your home screen is tailored to your condition of interest, showing you the latest global research â€” from promising breakthroughs in labs and clinical studies to inspiring success stories and even important lessons from setbacks in therapy development.

Each report includes a simple, easy-to-read summary in plain language, so that anyone can understand complex scientific findings without needing a medical background.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

- Personalized research feed.
- Stay connected with your community of interest with honest updates.
- AI descriptions and summaries of the research provided.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Description here
- **CSS** - The layout will be responsive (apparently Flexbox is supposed to be really easy to use, as well as css grid) and have a minimal color system (blue/orange/gray/lavender), and a light/dark mode toggle could be fun.
- **React** - Use of components like a condition selector and when the user picks a condition, the feed fetches and renders matching articles.
- **Service** - From what I understand, I'll start with a local json and then a real API that can normalize fields like title, source, date, and the AI plain-language summary.
- **DB/Login** - Use the AWS account locally and just have an email login with maybe bookmark tabs saved. 
- **WebSocket** - If I could get new feed updates without reloading the page, that's the hope for this part.
